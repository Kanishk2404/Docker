download docker in amazon linuz using->

sudo yum install docker - y
sudo su

sudo systemctl start docker

docker run hello-world
  
pull nginx , docker pull nginx -y , check running processes using docker ps, docker ps -a . 
now , 
docker -d -p 80:80 --name nginx-server nginx

now if you make html file and gice it port 80 it wont run because nginx already has it , and if you give 3000 port to it and make it run it wont have nginx until you make reverse proxy.

so, remove nginx services so that we will run html directly inside  nginx.

docker stop  nginx-server
  docker rm nginx-server

go to home , 

mkdir webpage . cd webpage .  nano index.html . chmod -R 755 webpage

  docker run -d -p 80:80 \
  -v /home/webpage:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
  --name my-nginx nginx

    -d is detach to make sure it runs and gives us terminal for work, -p is port and ec2 port maps port 80 to nginx -v is volume, docker bounds

  /home/webpage -> the host path

  /usr/share/nginx/html -> ontainer path â€” it's the default directory from which Nginx serves content.

So when Nginx starts inside the container, it looks in this folder for index.html.

With this mount, whatever you have in /home/webpage on the host becomes accessible as /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container.

  --name my-nginx
This gives the container a human-readable name, instead of a random one like hungry_snyder.

nginx
This tells Docker to:

Use the nginx image from Docker Hub.

What is -v in Docker?
-v stands for volume
In Docker, -v is used to mount a volume, which is a way of connecting your host machineâ€™s filesystem to a path inside the container.

ðŸ§  Think of it as:
"Let this folder (or file) on my EC2 machine be visible inside the container â€” as if itâ€™s a part of the containerâ€™s filesystem."

ðŸ“¦ Syntax of -v
bash
Copy
Edit
-v [host path]:[container path]:[access]
Part	Meaning
host path	The folder/file on your EC2 instance (e.g. /home/webpage)
container path	Where it should appear inside the container (e.g. /usr/share/nginx/html)
access (optional)	ro = read-only, rw = read-write (default is rw)
