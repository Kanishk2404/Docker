when you pull image of ubuntu is pulls the image, and when u run image of ubuntu it brings the image in running state but when you run exec -it bash ,
you make image into container and are inside it and use it

process ->

✅ 1. docker pull ubuntu
This downloads the Ubuntu image (from Docker Hub) onto your local machine.

Think of this as downloading a template of Ubuntu.

It doesn't run anything yet—just saves the image locally.

The image is read-only and used to spin up containers.

🔍 Result: You now have an Ubuntu image stored on your system.

✅ 2. docker run ubuntu
This creates and starts a new container based on the ubuntu image.

BUT you didn't specify -it or a command, so:

It created a container,

Ran the default command (which is just /bin/bash),

Exited immediately, because there was no interactive terminal (-it) to keep it open.

🧠 Important: Without -d, -it, or a running command, containers exit immediately when the command finishes.

🔍 Result: A container ran briefly and exited.

✅ 3. docker run -dit --name myubuntu ubuntu
Now you:

Created a new container named myubuntu,

Used flags:

-d: run in background (detached),

-i: keep STDIN open,

-t: allocate a terminal.

By default, it ran /bin/bash, but since it’s detached, it kept running in the background.

🔍 Result: You now have a running Ubuntu container called myubuntu.

✅ 4. docker exec -it myubuntu bash
Now you:

Executed (exec) a new command (bash) inside the already running container myubuntu,

Used -it so that you get an interactive terminal.

This drops you inside the Ubuntu shell of the running container.

🔍 Result: You’re now "inside" the Ubuntu container, just like being on a Linux machine.

📌 Analogy (Simple Understanding)
Step	Action	Analogy
pull	Download Ubuntu image	Like downloading an ISO of Ubuntu
run	Boot a one-time Ubuntu system	Like booting from ISO but closing it instantly
run -dit	Boot Ubuntu and leave it running	Like installing Ubuntu on a VM and leaving it running
exec	Open terminal in the running system	Like SSHing or opening a terminal in that running VM

🧠 Recap
Image = blueprint/template

Container = running instance of that blueprint

docker run = creates + starts container

docker exec = run commands inside a running container


Why not just use docker run -it ubuntu every time?
You can, and it works — but every time you do that without naming the container, Docker:

Creates a brand new container, with a random name (like amazing_einstein)

If you exit it, it stops

You have to remember or look up the container ID to reuse it

Any work done inside it (like installed packages) will disappear unless you commit or mount volumes

✅ Why use --name myubuntu?
Giving a container a name like myubuntu gives you full control and reusability:

🔄 You can re-enter it any time:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it myubuntu bash
🚀 You can start/stop it easily:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop myubuntu
docker start myubuntu
📦 It persists any changes:
If you installed tools (e.g. nano, curl, etc.), they're still there when you return.

📌 Real-life Analogy:
Without --name	With --name myubuntu
Like opening a new incognito tab every time	Like having a saved workspace
You lose everything on exit	You can resume right where you left
Random names like eager_raman	Consistent, memorable name like myubuntu
Hard to reuse	Easy to manage with exec, stop, start

🧠 Summary
Method	Use When You Want To...
docker run -it ubuntu	Just quickly try something once and throw it away
docker run -dit --name myubuntu ubuntu	Build a reusable Ubuntu environment
