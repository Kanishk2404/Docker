using bash inside ubuntu - > after pulling ubuntu image

docker run -it ubuntu	

docker run -dit --name myubuntu ubuntu -> Start named container in background

docker exec -it myubuntu bash	 -> executing bash inside ubuntu container

docker ps. will show all running containers.


-d
Detached mode: runs the container in the background.

You wonâ€™t see its terminal output immediately, but the container keeps running.

âœ… -i
Interactive mode: keeps STDIN open so you can interact with the container (required for bash or shell access).

âœ… -t
TTY allocation: attaches a pseudo-terminal (makes the shell look like a real terminal).

Needed for commands like bash to behave properly.

ðŸ§  Together, -it lets you interact with the container via a terminal.

âœ… --name myubuntu
Gives the container a custom name (myubuntu) instead of a random one.

Makes it easier to reference in future commands:

docker exec -it myubuntu bash

docker stop myubuntu

docker start myubuntu
