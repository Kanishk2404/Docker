1) make task definitions , name it whatever you want, like my-dockerhub-task then proceed to name

name whatever u want the containers and then put your image link,

then make clusters make sure the task is in this cluster only and then go to tasks in cluster then run the 
task , it might show create, and then if you want to update any revision go to task definitions then create 
new revision,uodate services and run taks again

task definition family -> my-dockerhub-task , aws fargate
container -1 name , node-demo , image kanishk2404/node-example-1
add all ports and everything

skip volumes nd everything for now and just create task definition

clusters - >  name it, aws fargate and create, then go in it, go to task, run new task, 
select to launch type, select task definition family to my-dockerhub-task itself,
go t netwokring by clicking on the link of task, edit the inbound security rules by going to ec2 which the task is using
then click on ipv4 link of it , now lets work with revision

go on to local folder, make changes in the code and rebuilt the iage
docker build -t node-dep-example1 .

docker tag node-dep-example1 kanishk2404/node-example-1

docker push kanishk2404/node-example-1

go ot task definition then click on the task named then create new revision, everyting same as usual
go to clusters then services
then go to task again, click and then networking,
